##More information
This site was originally made for the School of Demography at the National University of Australia. The goal was to design and develop the Australian Human Database. This database, inspired by the Human Mortality Database owned by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, contains Australiaâ€™s data exclusively. My job was to focus on developing the website within a short period. I have since revisited the design as a REACT project to improve the overall accessibility and usability.
