                    Scope of data processing <br>
                    As a matter of principle, we gather and utilise users' personal data only to the extent required to ensure the functioning of our website and of our contents and services.

            <h3>Provision of the website and creation of log files</h3>
            <p>
                Each time you visit our website, our service and applications automatically record data and information from the computer system of the visiting computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following data are gathered temporarily: 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your IP address; Date and time of your access to the website; Address of the page visited; Address of the previously visited website (referrer); Name and version of your browser/operating system (if transmitted). 
            </p>
            <p>
                These data are stored in our systems' log files. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Storage occurs in log files in order to ensure the website's functionality. The data also help us optimise the websites, eliminate malfunctions and ensure our IT system security. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were gathered. If data are gathered for the provision of the website, this is the case if the respective visit is ended. In the instance that data are stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is essential to operate the website. As a consequence, users do not have an option to revoke such data recording.

            <h3>Web analysis</h3>
            <p>
                For the statistical data recording of utilisation behaviour, we deploy the Matomo web analysis program (formerly: Piwik), which utilises cookies and JavaScript to collect various information on your computer and transmit it to us automatically. Each time you visit our websites, our system records the following data and information from the visiting computer's computer system:
            </p>
            <p>
                IP address, anonymised by shortening; Previously visited URL (referrer), if communicated by the browser; Name and version of the operating system; Name, version and language setting of the browser.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, if JavaScript is activated: URLs visited on this website; Times at which pages are visited; Type of HTML queries; Screen resolution and colour depth; Formats and techniques supported by the browser (e.g. cookies, Java, Flash, PDF, WindowsMedia, QuickTime, RealPlayer, Director, SilverLight, Google Gears). 
            </p>
            <p>
                The evaluation of the data we obtain enables us to aggregate information about the utilisation of our websites' individual components. This helps us constantly improve our websites and their user-friendliness 
            </p>
            <p>
                The data are deleted after the formation of the conclusive annual sums for access statistics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It goes that saying that you can revoke data gathering. You have the following possibility to revoke data recording by the central server: 
            </p>
            <p>
                In your browser, activate the do-not-track or do-not-follow settings. If these settings are active, our central server will not store any data relating to you. Important: The do-not-track instruction generally applies only for the device and browser in which you activate the setting. If you utilise several devices/browsers, you will need to separately activate do-not-track in all relevant locations.
