[Previously saved workspace restored]



 Heads up : experience has shown that saving your workspace on quitting R 
is a bad idea when your environment holds many GB of stuff. Consequently
this R is configured to NOT save your workspace on quitting.

Rstudio, however does not understand this -- to save headaches YOU MUST configure
Rstudio to never save .RData and to not read existing .RData files

 If you have library(shiny) attached, type HMDqc() to start the GUI to run the HMD diagnostic checks.
       
 Otherwise, use a wrapper function for the SetParams and RunHMDCountry functions.
